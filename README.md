# [SNP and genotype calling]( https://helenhip.github.io/SNP-and-genotype-calling/)
#### Victor Soria-Carrasco & Helen Hipperson

The aim of this practical is to learn how to call single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and genotypes, that is the process of identifying variable sites and determining the genotype for each individual at each site. We will be using a dataset of whole genome sequence data of 32 samples (16 inviduals x 2 tissues) of *Heliconius melpomene*. After calling SNPs, we will do some subsetting and filtering and will carry out a few example analyses. If you feel ready, click on the title to start the practical.
